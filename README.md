# PFMS MiniPC Bootstrapper

A lightweight backend service written in Go for securely provisioning and bootstrapping PFMS MiniPCs in the field. This server validates MiniPC devices and delivers the correct software installer based on their request ‚Äî without requiring user tokens, manual input, or interactive authentication.


## üì¶ Overview

The PFMS MiniPC Bootstrapper is designed to support automated setups in remote fuel station environments. It provides:

- ‚úÖ Self-validation of MiniPCs using `deviceId`
- ‚úÖ Secure distribution of install scripts (version-controlled)
- ‚úÖ Static file hosting for `.sh` installer scripts
- ‚úÖ Request logging for monitoring and auditing
- ‚ùå No user interaction required (fully backend-driven)

## üß© How It Works

1. A MiniPC sends a POST request to `/init` with its `deviceId`, `os`, and requested `version`.
2. The backend checks whether the device is authorized.
3. If valid, it responds with a download URL pointing to the correct installer script.
4. The MiniPC then downloads and executes the script to complete installation.
